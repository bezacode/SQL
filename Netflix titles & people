# The following syntax was written in PostgreSQL, 2 tables are involved:

# Table 1 :"Victorbeza/bezacode"."netflix_titles_info"
#Columns/ attributes: show_id, type, title, country,date_added, release_year, rating,duration, lised_in, description

# Table 2 :"Victorbeza/bezacode"."netflix_people"
#Columns/ attributes: show_id, director, cast



#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows) 

select count(*) 
FROM "Victorbeza/bezacode"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';
#note the use of single quotes in WHERE type='Movie'
#In PostgreSQL, you have to use single quotes to select strings,
#because double quotes are part of the syntax for the FROM statement.

#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 

select max(date(date_added))
FROM "Victorbeza/bezacode"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.

select title
FROM "Victorbeza/bezacode"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 

select 
director
FROM "Victorbeza/bezacode"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN  "Victorbeza/bezacode"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
where titles.title='Bright Star'

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 

select title, release_year
FROM "Victorbeza/bezacode"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;
# NOTE: The above SQL gives you a correct answer,
# but there are actually 2 movies that came out that year! 
# You can see the second one by changing
# LIMIT 1 to LIMIT 2. 
# Or, you can use a "subquery" like this to see all the oldest movies
# without assuming that there was only 1 that year: 

SELECT title, release_year 
FROM "Victorbeza/bezacode"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year <= 
(SELECT MIN(release_year) 
FROM "Victorbeza/bezacode"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie');
